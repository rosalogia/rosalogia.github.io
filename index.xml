      <description>This page contains links to some of the small applications I&amp;rsquo;ve built that are demonstrated on this site. Projects that don&amp;rsquo;t have web front-ends only exist on my GitHub account.
ReqCheck ReqCheck is an application for Rutgers Computer Science and Math students to find out which courses they&amp;rsquo;re eligible to take in coming semesters by inputting the courses they&amp;rsquo;ve taken (or will have taken by a certain point) so far.</description>

      <title>Solving the Barcode Problem</title>

      <description>The first assignment of Rutgers University&amp;rsquo;s Introduction to Computer Science course (01:198:111) this fall included a barcode checksumming problem whose constraints made it a little confusing even for experienced programmers. The problem is referenced in the third weekly homework assignment, and some of us are still struggling to understand how to approach it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over a few of the techniques we can employ to solve the problem in a clean and efficient way without exposing a full-code solution, as this would be against the collaboration policy.</description>

      <description>This page is a growing compilation of free resources for learning to use various technologies, tools, and skills that I find interesting, fun, productive or essential. Most if not all of them are those which I&amp;rsquo;ve used myself. They are listed in order of relative complexity to a new programmer.
Pre-Programming There are some things that you might want to know about, learn about, set up, and/or install before beginning to program.</description>

      <title>Configuring Saturn to Use Postgres</title>

      <description>Saturn is a modern MVC-oriented web framework for F# built on .NET Core, making it a suitable option for cross-platform development and deployment on unix-like operating systems, which for me is a must. The F# community is really enthusiastic about a feature of the F# language and environment which they lovingly refer to as type providers. When it comes to type providers, the objective is usually to provide some kind of immediate and type-safe mapping between an external data source and your F# codebase.</description>

      <description>The bulk of the content I plan on including in this site has to do with helping less experienced programmers in my class familiarise themselves with programming tools, practices and environments that are more common and useful outside of an academic [or, at least, undergraduate] environment. Python is a simple and powerful programming language that sees a lot of use in professional, casual and open-source spaces, and knowing it can make you more employable but can also help you make your life easier or participate in open source projects that interest you.</description>

      <title>Setting Up a Discord Bot Development Environment with Python</title>

      <description>This guide was originally written to meet the particular needs of the Rutgers Computer Science - Class of 2024 Discord Bot, and has been included on this site because I personally feel that it is a generally useful and informative guide for those who have never developed outside of an academic environment, and wish to familiarise themselves with the tools and procedures of open source development.
RUCS24-Bot is a Discord bot written in Python.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is Ambika. You can learn a little about me and what I do on this page:
 I am a student of Computer Science at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, minoring in Marine Sciences. I develop and contribute to open-source software projects that I make use of or that interest me. I am particularly enthusiastic about the functional programming paradigm, as well as the F# and OCaml programming languages.</description>
