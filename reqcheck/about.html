                    <h4>How to Use ReqCheck</h4>
                    ReqCheck takes in a list of computer science and math courses you've taken at Rutgers and returns a list of Computer Science courses
                    you're now eligible to enroll in based on your inputs.<br><br>In order to use the application, begin typing in the name or course-code of
                    each CS or math course you have taken at RU and notice that you'll get automated suggestions as you type. Click on the suggestion
                    matching the name and course-code of the course you're typing in, then continue to the next one. Once you've entered all the
                    relevant courses you've taken, hit submit to see a list of CS courses you can now take.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are here to test out the application but don't go to Rutgers, you can try the following set of inputs:

                    <ul>
                        <li>01:198:111 - Introduction to Computer Science</li>
                        <li>01:640:151 - Calculus I for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences</li>
                        <li>01:640:152 - Calculus II for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences</li>
                        <li>01:198:112 - Data Structures</li>
                        <li>01:198:211 - Computer Architecture</li>
                        <li>01:198:205 - Introduction to Discrete Structures I</li>
                    </ul>

                    This set of inputs will result in a handful of interesting electives appearing in the list below.

                    <h4>About ReqCheck</h4>
                    ReqCheck was developed primarily as a web API in OCaml using <a href="https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium">opium</a>.
                    OCaml is a statically typed functional programming language that sees wide use in both academic as well as professional
                    contexts. The program consists of two significant parts:
                    <ul class="browser-default">
                        <li>A parser back-end that reads in pre-requisite information for courses and builds a sort of boolean AST which is used
                            to compute which courses are available to a student who has taken a particular set of courses.</li>
                        <li>An opium "front-end" which is really just a HTTP API that defines two GET endpoints: /all which returns all the courses
                            in the Rutgers' CS department along with their pre-requisites, and /allowed which takes a list of courses the student
                            has completed as a query parameter and returns a JSON list of courses the student is eligible to take.</li>
                    </ul>

                    The parser for ReqCheck was built using the <a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a> parser-combinator
                    library for OCaml. Parser-combinators provide a beautiful, functional, monadic interface for parsing that makes implementing
                    parsers for complex grammars relatively trivial, as well as enjoyable.

                    ReqCheck took about 5 days in total to develop. OCaml itself is quick and enjoyable to work in, though I often found that a lack
                    of documentation or answered questions regarding issues with external dependencies on the internet was slowing me down. Dune, the
                    OCaml build tool, could potentially benefit from a good and thorough tutorial that walks the user through setting up an entire
                    project. Angstrom could use hosted documentation as well as more built-in parser-combinators. I feel that much could be added to
                    Angstrom by looking to Parsec and FParsec (parser-combinators for Haskell and F# respectively) for inspiration and examples. Angstrom
                    could also benefit from a nice tutorial.
